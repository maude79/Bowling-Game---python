Bowling Case - Test Report
==========================

Assumptions made and other notes:
---------------------------------
* The program has been written in python.

* The program has been written in python, version 3.7,  no need for any specific 
  packages / modules installed other than the standard python packages

* The input file is located in the same directory as the program itself, no 
  other checks performed other than making sure the file exists.

* Tests performed:
 - Reading the command line

  + Input file is passed
    If a ‘-f <file_name>’ is passed as optional argument to the script, the 
    script verifies that the file exists before parsing it. If no valid file is 
    found, the script prints error message and exits

          maude$ ./bowling.py -f non_existent_file
          File 'non_existent_file' does not exist - pls provide a valid file name    
          maude$ 

 
  + If a filename is passed without the ‘-f’, script prints usage
 
          maude$ ./bowling.py input_file1 
          usage: bowling.py [-h] [-file FILE]
          bowling.py: error: unrecognized arguments: input_file1
 
 
  + Running the script without the ‘-f’ options generates a random game

          maude$ ./bowling.py
          | f1 | f2 | f3 | f4 | f5 | f6 | f7 | f8 | f9 | f10 |
          |8, /|4, 1|4, /|8, 1|7, 2|2, 7|6, 2|8, /|5, 3|3, - |
          Game score: 98
          maude$ ./bowling.py
          | f1 | f2 | f3 | f4 | f5 | f6 | f7 | f8 | f9 | f10 |
          |-, 1|7, /|2, 3|3, 1|6, /|3, 2|6, 1|6, 1|8, -|1, 6 |
          Game score: 69
          maude$ 


 - File format checks

  + Any other character than digits is not accepted

          maude$ cat wrong_file_format1
          2,, 5, 4, 9, 1, 2, 5, 3, 2, 4, 2, 3, 3, 4, 6, 10, 0, 10, 4, 2
          maude$ ./bowling.py -f wrong_file_format1
          Input file must contain comma separated list of integers only

          maude$ cat wrong_file_format2
          2, 3, 5, 4, 9, 1, h, 5, 3, 2, 4, 2, 3, 3, 4, 6, 10, 0, 10, 4, 2
          maude$ ./bowling.py -f wrong_file_format2
          Input file must contain comma separated list of integers only


  + Digits that are greater than 10 or negative are not accepted

          maude$ cat file_with_too_big_numbers 
          2, 3, 5, 14, 9, 1, 2, 5, 3, 2, 4, 2, 3, 3, 4, 6, 10, 0, 10, 4, 2
          maude$ ./bowling.py -f file_with_too_big_numbers 
          Values > 10 are not accepted, only values between 0 and 10

          maude$ cat file_with_negative_numbers 
          2, 3, 5, -4, 9, 1, 2, 5, 3, 2, 4, 2, 3, 3, 4, 6, 10, 0, 10, 4, 2
          maude$ ./bowling.py -f file_with_negative_numbers 
          Negative values are not accepted, only values between 0 and 10


  + Frames with a total score larger than 10 are not accepted

          maude$ cat file_frames_with_total_exceeding_10
          2, 3, 5, 4, 9, 1, 2, 5, 3, 2, 4, 8, 3, 3, 4, 6, 10, 0, 10, 4, 2
          maude$ ./bowling.py -f file_frames_with_total_exceeding_10
          Sum of frame points 4 and 8 (idx:10 and 11) exceeds 10


  + If the 10th frame has a strike or spare and bonus rolls are missing, it is not accepted

          maude$ cat file_missing_bonus_rolls 
          2, 3, 5, 4, 9, 1, 2, 5, 3, 2, 4, 2, 3, 3, 4, 6, 10, 10, 4
          maude$ ./bowling.py -f file_missing_bonus_rolls
          Input file is missing bonus rolls

          maude$ cat file_missing_bonus_rolls2
          2, 3, 5, 4, 9, 1, 2, 5, 3, 2, 4, 2, 3, 3, 4, 6, 10, 9, 1
          maude$ ./bowling.py -f file_missing_bonus_rolls2
          Input file is missing bonus rolls


 - Randomly generated games: verified that program computes valid frames

          maude$ ./bowling.py
          | f1 | f2 | f3 | f4 | f5 | f6 | f7 | f8 | f9 | f10 |
          |X   |X   |2, 6|8, -|5, 3|5, -|2, 2|3, 5|1, 8|8, 1 |
          Game score: 99

          maude$ ./bowling.py
          | f1 | f2 | f3 | f4 | f5 | f6 | f7 | f8 | f9 |  f10  |
          |5, 2|8, -|5, /|X   |3, -|-, 3|8, 1|1, 7|-, 1|7, /, 2 |
          Game score: 84

          maude$ ./bowling.py
          | f1 | f2 | f3 | f4 | f5 | f6 | f7 | f8 | f9 | f10 |
          |1, 2|3, 5|3, 6|-, X|7, 1|4, -|-, 6|7, -|8, -|6, 1 |
          Game score: 78

          maude$ ./bowling.py
          | f1 | f2 | f3 | f4 | f5 | f6 | f7 | f8 | f9 | f10 |
          |-, 1|4, -|4, -|1, -|1, 5|5, /|X   |8, 1|1, 3|7, 1 |
          Game score: 76

          maude$ ./bowling.py
          | f1 | f2 | f3 | f4 | f5 | f6 | f7 | f8 | f9 | f10 |
          |-, 3|X   |8, -|-, 6|4, 2|9, /|X   |3, 3|X   |3, 1 |
          Game score: 101


 - Score check
  + Verified that the program computed the correct scores for both randomly
    generated games and input file generated games.
  + Created a small script that re-ran the program with random game generation 
    every 2 seconds to verify both the score results and that to rule out that 
    the program didn’t have any bug that may only be triggered under very 
    specific circumstances.
